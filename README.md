# HCM Artifacts Registry

This repository functions as a **witness registry** for artifacts that have emerged
from HCM-aligned fields.

It does not store artifacts.
It does not rank them.
It does not optimize their visibility.

It only records that an artifact has passed.

Presence is acknowledged.
Meaning is not extracted.
Value is not enforced.

This registry exists to allow coherence without capture.
